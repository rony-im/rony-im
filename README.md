- 👋 Hi, I’m @rony-im and I'm from Ecuador, hope you´re having a wonderful day.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing apps that help the world to be better. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and MEAN technologies, I'll be learning also more technologies related to web and app development. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people who have more knowledge than me because I'm trying to get experience to grow as a Software Developer.
