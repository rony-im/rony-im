- 👋 Hi, I’m @rony-im and I'm from Ecuador, hope you´re having a wonderful day.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing apps that help the world to be better. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and MEAN technologies, I'll be learning also more technologies related to web and app development. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people who have more knowledge than me because I'm trying to get experience to grow as a Software Developer.
- 📫 Feel invited to contact me through:

I know we can change the world for good, we only have to try it.

I'll upload all my proyects here so you can take a look and make use of them if you consider.

You can also tell me if it's good or if it needs to be changed (I hope for the first option).

Be safe, use face mask.

Have a nice day!
